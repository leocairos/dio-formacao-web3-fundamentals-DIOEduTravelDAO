DAO project for DIO's Web3 Fundamentals Training

## Vision

DIO EduTravel DAO seeks to revolutionize the way people explore the world and acquire knowledge by providing a decentralized platform that connects travel and learning enthusiasts worldwide. We want to create an autonomous global community that facilitates the exchange of educational and travel experiences, enriching lives and promoting cultural understanding.

## Mission

At DIO EduTravel DAO, we believe that knowledge and exploration transcend borders. Our mission is to create an autonomous global community that empowers individuals to explore the world, learn from other cultures and share their own educational experiences. We are committed to connecting people in meaningful ways by promoting education, understanding and mutual respect. Join us in redefining how we learn, travel and connect in an increasingly interconnected age.

## Goals

- **Global Connection:** DIO EduTravel DAO aims to connect people from different cultures and backgrounds through travel and shared learning experiences.

- **Decentralization and Autonomy:** Our platform will operate in a fully decentralized way, where DAO members will have a voice in decisions related to destinations, study programs and general governance. Access to the platform is available at https://app.aragon.org/#/daos/goerli/dioedutravel.dao.eth.

- **Security and Trust:** We prioritize security and trust among community members, so we will implement profile verification protocols and safeguards to protect everyone's interests.

- **Participation Incentives:** The DIO EduTravel DAO will reward members who actively contribute to the community, whether through sharing experiences, organizing travel or promoting learning.

## Operation

Interested parties can purchase DIO EduTravel DAO (DETDAO) tokens, becoming members with the right to participate in the organization's decisions.

Members can propose educational trips, courses or learning experiences in different parts of the world.

The community votes on the proposals, deciding which experiments to run.

The platform allows the sharing of knowledge and skills through tutorials, workshops and online interactions.

Partnerships with educational institutions and travel providers can be established to offer exclusive discounts to DAO members.
